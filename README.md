# Flame-Citron
English subtitle for flame and Citron
1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Freely based on actual events

2
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:43,901
Do you remember when they came?

3
00:00:47,752 --> 00:00:51,752
Do you remember April 9?

4
00:00:54,446 --> 00:00:57,277
I believe you do.
Everybody does.

5
00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:04,314
They were suddenly everywhere.

6
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:08,599
Gestapo, Wehrmacht, Abwehr, SS.

7
00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:12,755
All the German units.

8
00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:16,915
German Nazis.

9
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:21,511
Danish Nazis.

10
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:29,039
They all came out of the darkness.

11
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:32,354
They had just been waiting for this day.

12
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:41,198
Did you go out to look at it?

13
00:01:47,326 --> 00:01:50,440
What did you think?

14
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:44,073
You must be deliberate.

15
00:02:44,246 --> 00:02:46,553
Execute your plan.

16
00:02:56,326 --> 00:03:00,032
If you're calm,
nobody will discover anything.

17
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:05,439
People look at the dead.

18
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:07,914
Not at anything else.

19
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:13,802
They don't see you disappearing.

20
00:03:16,245 --> 00:03:19,791
They cannot remember
that you have been there ...

21
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:21,840
... at all.

22
00:03:29,326 --> 00:03:32,156
I know I'm doing the right thing.

23
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:37,239
There is nothing else to do.

24
00:03:38,406 --> 00:03:40,361
Do you understand?

25
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,480
Yes.

26
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:23,555
Yes?

27
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:27,874
Flowers from Dagmarhus.
A birthday bouquet, I think.

28
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:33,910
- ÿstergaard Petersen?
- That's correct.

29
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:36,836
Should I sign?

30
00:05:37,006 --> 00:05:38,404
No.

31
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:50,277
You often asked why.

32
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:54,761
Why we do this.

33
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:59,717
Why?

34
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:13,275
- Don't provoke them.
- Yes, yes.

35
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:20,080
One good reason:

36
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:24,118
The Schalburg Corps.

37
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:26,717
Good morning.

38
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:28,953
Papers.

39
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,159
No, I don't think so.
Have you seen the paper?

40
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:37,753
Danes in German uniforms.
Traitors.

41
00:06:40,886 --> 00:06:44,034
Some are trained soldiers
from the Eastern Front.

42
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:46,081
Brutal pigs.

43
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:49,042
Impossible to get close to them.

44
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:51,923
Always in groups.

45
00:06:57,806 --> 00:07:00,476
They are ... pests.

46
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:05,673
Drive!

47
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:20,602
The ambulance crews help.

48
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:25,757
The police help.

49
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:32,637
Anyone who dares helps.

50
00:07:39,886 --> 00:07:44,160
They have raised the reward to
10,000 kroner.

51
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:47,236
- For both of us?
- Only for you.

52
00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:50,793
- What do they know?
- They know that you have red hair.

53
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:54,273
Get the hair dyed, Bent.

54
00:07:54,445 --> 00:07:56,798
Or put on a hat.

55
00:07:56,965 --> 00:08:01,080
- Hat?
- Yes, or a cap.

56
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:03,678
It's him.

57
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:06,515
Another good reason:

58
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:13,557
Nazi editors who spread
their propaganda in the newspapers.

59
00:08:16,405 --> 00:08:18,475
Editor Gaust?

60
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:29,877
Everybody has their reasons.

61
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:36,280
On April 9 J¯rgen watches
the Germans march into the city.

62
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:42,278
The endless ranks of soldiers
make him throw up.

63
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:46,393
He is nauseous.

64
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:52,472
He keeps on being nauseous.

65
00:08:54,004 --> 00:09:00,791
Until the day last summer when he
goes into a store to buy a radio for his wife.

66
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:06,192
In the back room they
are printing illegal newspapers.

67
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:10,037
J¯rgen finally finds somebody
who feels like him.

68
00:09:10,206 --> 00:09:14,115
Before long, they start illegal actions.

69
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:19,277
J¯rgen and a few others are the
only ones left from that group.

70
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:23,878
All others have either fled to Sweden,
or they're dead.

71
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:26,913
Executed.

72
00:09:27,085 --> 00:09:30,314
But J¯rgen ...
J¯rgen keeps going on.

73
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:36,632
Smuggles English pilots over the sound at night.
Helps with explosives.

74
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:39,192
Taking pills to stay awake.

75
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:42,718
Organizes weapons.
Everything.

76
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:47,196
And then he drives with me.

77
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:31,675
Time?

78
00:10:31,846 --> 00:10:34,721
11:25.
Shoot in the neck.

79
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:40,034
Aksel Winther. Police lawyer.
The most important of us.

80
00:10:40,812 --> 00:10:45,911
He has access to virtually all
confidential channels at the Police House.

81
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:53,354
He has his own contacts with the English.
Receives orders directly.

82
00:10:53,524 --> 00:10:57,197
Last autumn he organized
the escape of the Jews.

83
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,958
Without him, there would be nothing.

84
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,079
As far as I know,
we have a clear chain of command.

85
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:07,553
- I had not approved the execution of Gaust today.
- We decided that it was safe.

86
00:11:07,725 --> 00:11:12,475
- And we were just nearby.
- Oh, really.

87
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:17,591
A signature for the gentlemen in Stockholm.

88
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:20,992
There's something coming up.

89
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:24,154
It requires discretion ...

90
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:26,439
... and the strictest discipline.

91
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,833
- You'll like it.
- When it's Winther, ...

92
00:11:30,006 --> 00:11:32,597
- It's big.
- ... everything is big.

93
00:11:32,765 --> 00:11:35,072
Fatherland.

94
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:42,510
Who else would celebrate three assassinations
in a liquor store with the Germans.

95
00:11:42,684 --> 00:11:44,321
You have to be cool.

96
00:11:58,765 --> 00:12:02,516
We are not many.
It is difficult to say who does what.

97
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:06,992
Sometimes we work together.
Other times we work separately.

98
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:12,155
That's Bob,
veteran of the winter war in Finland.

99
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:17,678
The teacher, the Wise, an expert in
finding information on everything and everyone.

100
00:12:18,845 --> 00:12:23,790
Big Bear, an expert in women,
Always ready to party.

101
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:26,681
And Little Bear,
good with weapons.

102
00:12:26,845 --> 00:12:31,835
Rumors say that when they must shoot a
man, they also shoot his woman.

103
00:12:32,005 --> 00:12:38,439
The wine merchant exchange information.
Sells them to us and the Germans.

104
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:43,551
Banana, a former boxer joins
in all the actions he can get.

105
00:12:43,726 --> 00:12:47,715
Carl, a nervous guy,
but tough when it matters.

106
00:12:47,886 --> 00:12:53,035
Heinrich and Teddy,
students, the youngest.

107
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:58,957
Smalle, he talks and talks,
never shuts up, especially about food.

108
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:03,751
Cap, a former nun in Belgium.
Has her own group in Kastrup.

109
00:13:03,926 --> 00:13:06,915
Banana protects her.

110
00:13:14,684 --> 00:13:18,230
And J¯rgen, my friend.

111
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:39,631
We have talked about that.
You stay away from him.

112
00:13:39,804 --> 00:13:44,591
Karl Heinz Hoffmann.
The Gestapo chief.

113
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:51,196
It is he who chases us.

114
00:13:53,244 --> 00:13:55,995
Hoffman wants to talk to you.

115
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:05,760
Make no mistake.

116
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:09,709
Denmark has never had
a greater mass murderer than him.

117
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:17,677
But you know all about that already.

118
00:14:42,445 --> 00:14:45,479
May I offer you a glass?

119
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:50,714
Sorry.
Svend Christensen, detective.

120
00:14:57,725 --> 00:15:02,635
- What's your name?
- Ketty ... Ketty Selmer.

121
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:09,390
- Cheers, Svend Christensen.
- Cheers.

122
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:20,520
It's excellent.

123
00:15:20,684 --> 00:15:23,241
Are you married?

124
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:27,034
Yes.

125
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:34,750
- I haven't seen you here before.
- I travel a lot.

126
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:38,801
- Exciting. What do you do?
- I am a fashion designer.

127
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:43,477
Photographer. I just made
a series for Women of Today.

128
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:50,159
- Who are you?
- Thank you for the wine.

129
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,631
I asked you about something.

130
00:15:52,804 --> 00:15:55,795
You ask too much.
Goodbye, Bent.

131
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:05,873
"Goodbye, Bent."

132
00:16:06,085 --> 00:16:09,757
It may be one of the boys,
who have talked too much.

133
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:12,994
They would never give her my name.

134
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,679
There she is.

135
00:16:18,084 --> 00:16:22,518
Bent, it's a German hotel.
It's packed with them in there.

136
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:28,755
- I'll just go in there.
- Here?

137
00:16:29,804 --> 00:16:34,078
If you're not back in half an hour,
I'll go in there.

138
00:16:40,484 --> 00:16:44,110
Criminal Investigation.
Ketty Selmer?

139
00:17:12,245 --> 00:17:14,962
What do you want?

140
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:19,272
May I come in?

141
00:17:36,484 --> 00:17:38,632
Who do you know?

142
00:17:40,324 --> 00:17:43,710
I design fashion
and do fashion photography.

143
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:46,872
- I see.
- Why did you call me Bent?

144
00:17:47,043 --> 00:17:49,555
I thought that was your name.

145
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:56,679
What do you really do?

146
00:17:58,484 --> 00:18:01,235
- I cannot say.
- You must.

147
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:09,078
I am a courier. Stockholm - Copenhagen.
I deliver messages.

148
00:18:09,244 --> 00:18:15,109
- I know the wine merchant.
- He just passes on information.

149
00:18:15,283 --> 00:18:19,034
He is a middle man.
Nobody works for a middle man.

150
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,716
I also know Winther.

151
00:18:24,883 --> 00:18:27,600
What do you do for Winther?

152
00:18:27,764 --> 00:18:31,036
I can't say.
You know that, too.

153
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:34,397
- That's not why you came.
- Isn't it?

154
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:39,080
It is something else you have come for.

155
00:18:41,324 --> 00:18:44,041
I don't sleep with married women.

156
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:49,068
My husband is gay.
My marriage is a sham.

157
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:53,200
He is Swedish,
so I can travel back and forth.

158
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:57,162
Are you attracted to me?

159
00:18:57,325 --> 00:18:59,790
Yes.

160
00:18:59,964 --> 00:19:02,839
Why?

161
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:05,880
Because you're beautiful.

162
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:10,042
How old are you?

163
00:19:10,204 --> 00:19:12,955
23. Why?

164
00:19:14,004 --> 00:19:16,390
You're young.

165
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:19,235
Age means something.

166
00:19:19,404 --> 00:19:22,552
Now go.

167
00:19:22,724 --> 00:19:26,316
- Selmer, is it your real name?
- Yes.

168
00:19:29,004 --> 00:19:30,958
Go.

169
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:45,359
This is my landlady, Lis.

170
00:19:45,524 --> 00:19:48,160
And her husband, Helmer.

171
00:19:49,204 --> 00:19:52,273
This is where I live.

172
00:19:54,524 --> 00:19:56,752
I live in their basement.

173
00:19:56,924 --> 00:20:00,038
It's a good place.

174
00:20:00,203 --> 00:20:04,432
It's good to wait.
That's the way it is.

175
00:20:06,444 --> 00:20:10,433
Most of the time is spent waiting.

176
00:20:25,844 --> 00:20:30,073
This is Horst Ernst Gilbert, editor
the Scandinavian Telegrambureau.

177
00:20:30,244 --> 00:20:32,710
He spits out German propaganda.

178
00:20:32,884 --> 00:20:37,431
Political refugee from 1934.
He is a spy and colonel in the Abwehr.

179
00:20:37,605 --> 00:20:40,560
Closest collaborator is
Hermann Seibold.

180
00:20:40,724 --> 00:20:44,838
SS-Obersturmbannf¸hrer.
Chief of Espionage in Scandinavia.

181
00:20:45,004 --> 00:20:48,198
The last one is
Mrs Elisabeth Lorentzen.

182
00:20:48,364 --> 00:20:54,957
From Schleswig-Holstein. Author.
Highly placed in Abwehr and Gilbert's secretary.

183
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:00,517
Have some cake.

184
00:21:02,324 --> 00:21:04,324
This is real coffee.

185
00:21:04,403 --> 00:21:07,403
- They're Germans?
- Yes, they're German spies.

186
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:09,407
Yes, but still Germans.

187
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:13,675
Doesn't the Freedom Council ban us
from liquidating Germans?

188
00:21:13,843 --> 00:21:18,073
It is rather a recommendation.
Which we don't follow.

189
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:24,348
- London wants to eradicate Abwehr.
- Have I misunderstood something?

190
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:28,116
Are we not trying to get rid of
Danish informers and Nazis?

191
00:21:28,283 --> 00:21:33,070
Yes, but you're now assigned to Special Forces.
You do as you're told.

192
00:21:33,244 --> 00:21:34,914
Fine.

193
00:21:38,124 --> 00:21:41,670
- What do you say, Bent?
- Perfect.

194
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:45,799
- But I don't shoot women.
- You don't?

195
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:50,759
Then you do it, Citronen.

196
00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:55,835
Or do you also have
a problem with women?

197
00:21:57,243 --> 00:21:59,630
No, I don't.

198
00:22:00,723 --> 00:22:04,111
If we're going to shoot senior German officers.

199
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:08,670
Then I think we should take Hoffmann.
Then we can paralyze the entire Gestapo.

200
00:22:08,843 --> 00:22:12,470
- There is no order for that.
- You can give that order.

201
00:22:12,643 --> 00:22:14,633
I will not!

202
00:22:14,803 --> 00:22:18,510
You stay away from Hoffmann.
Both of you.

203
00:22:23,364 --> 00:22:27,751
Bent, you must not engage
in a conversation with Gilbert.

204
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:34,391
He has a great personality and has a ...
significant intellectual potential.

205
00:22:34,564 --> 00:22:37,950
- You knock on the door and shoot him.
- Yes.

206
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,470
Good evening, Mr. Nielsen.

207
00:22:47,643 --> 00:22:50,553
I met a woman yesterday.
Ketty Selmer.

208
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:52,757
Did you?

209
00:22:52,923 --> 00:22:56,230
She's not someone
you should get mixed up with.

210
00:23:21,284 --> 00:23:24,637
- Are you waiting for me?
- Yes.

211
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:28,838
- What do you want?
- How do you know my name?

212
00:23:29,003 --> 00:23:34,631
- Someone has talked too much.
- Yes. The only question is who.

213
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:37,759
Don't be afraid.
We're on the same team.

214
00:23:37,923 --> 00:23:40,071
Are we?

215
00:23:41,362 --> 00:23:44,796
Is it Winther?

216
00:23:44,964 --> 00:23:49,590
You must not ask me.
And don't ask me to do anything for you.

217
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:53,150
And don't come here.
That is the last thing I need.

218
00:23:53,323 --> 00:23:55,438
Good night.

219
00:23:56,763 --> 00:24:00,469
I was going to shoot this woman.
She who betrayed Finn.

220
00:24:01,804 --> 00:24:03,758
I come up the stairs.

221
00:24:03,924 --> 00:24:10,187
I knock on the door. She opens the door.
I am going to pull the trigger ...

222
00:24:10,363 --> 00:24:15,387
She manages to tell me
that she's not really an informer.

223
00:24:15,564 --> 00:24:19,189
She informed on him,
because he has betrayed her.

224
00:24:19,363 --> 00:24:24,671
He had promised to marry her,
but he was already married.

225
00:24:24,843 --> 00:24:28,230
She was a lonely, abandoned woman.

226
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:33,990
She stood there and stared at me.

227
00:24:34,163 --> 00:24:37,073
I couldn't pull the trigger.

228
00:24:38,523 --> 00:24:41,081
She wept and wept.

229
00:24:43,244 --> 00:24:45,551
I couldn't.

230
00:24:47,324 --> 00:24:50,279
I peed in my pants and ran.

231
00:24:51,764 --> 00:24:55,639
The next week she informed on two more.

232
00:24:57,282 --> 00:25:00,909
I have sworn,
it must not happen again.

233
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:04,232
Why couldn't you?

234
00:25:04,404 --> 00:25:09,075
I forgot that it's not people we shoot.
It is Nazis.

235
00:25:12,323 --> 00:25:14,995
She's yours, J¯rgen.

236
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,597
We must go.

237
00:25:57,084 --> 00:26:02,517
If you don't come back within
five minutes, I come up. Ready?

238
00:26:49,883 --> 00:26:52,872
I couldn't.

239
00:26:54,603 --> 00:26:58,798
I only hit her in the shoulder.

240
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:03,987
I have never killed anyone before, Bent.
Sorry.

241
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:41,236
- Who are you?
- I come from Winther.

242
00:28:41,403 --> 00:28:44,517
I'm here to deliver
some legal documents.

243
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:48,354
- May I see your badge?
- Yes, of course.

244
00:28:53,323 --> 00:28:58,790
You have to be careful.
My husband is resting.

245
00:29:00,683 --> 00:29:02,751
Do you want a cup of tea?

246
00:29:35,802 --> 00:29:38,838
"Thanks, Bud Jonny."

247
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:43,514
The famous Soviet general.
I trained him myself, Mr. ..?

248
00:29:43,683 --> 00:29:47,275
Christensen.
Svend Christensen.

249
00:29:47,442 --> 00:29:53,070
After the First World War many German
officers tried their luck in the Red Army.

250
00:29:53,243 --> 00:29:57,710
Germany was poor and lay in ruins.

251
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:02,474
The Russian officers who
are now fighting against the German army ...

252
00:30:02,643 --> 00:30:05,712
... were trained by us.

253
00:30:07,843 --> 00:30:10,957
But you know that already.

254
00:30:15,003 --> 00:30:16,720
You come from my friend Winther?

255
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:21,349
Yes. I was asked to deliver
these documents to you.

256
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:25,432
Thank you.
Is there something wrong with your hand?

257
00:30:25,602 --> 00:30:28,671
You speak excellent German,
Mr. Christensen.

258
00:30:28,843 --> 00:30:32,878
Thank you.
I have lived in Germany.

259
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:36,315
My father sent me there.

260
00:30:39,282 --> 00:30:42,669
You are in the resistance movement.

261
00:30:45,522 --> 00:30:50,309
I mean you come from Winther.
You can relax.

262
00:30:50,483 --> 00:30:55,599
I have no particular sympathy
for Hitler or National Socialism.

263
00:30:57,965 --> 00:31:04,032
But you have taken an oath to Hitler.
- That I will decide with my conscience.

264
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:10,433
You are a partisan.

265
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:14,228
That's very interesting.

266
00:31:14,402 --> 00:31:17,709
A soldier without a front.

267
00:31:20,562 --> 00:31:23,438
Are you also a good soldier?

268
00:31:24,323 --> 00:31:27,118
Are you prepared to pay the price?

269
00:31:29,402 --> 00:31:33,027
- What price?
- What do you think?

270
00:31:33,201 --> 00:31:34,996
Life.

271
00:31:38,322 --> 00:31:43,676
You see, there are only three reasons
to fight in a war.

272
00:31:43,843 --> 00:31:46,514
The first is career.

273
00:31:46,682 --> 00:31:50,673
It is very common, but it
doesn't make for a good soldier.

274
00:31:50,843 --> 00:31:55,469
People are scared of dying
and only think about the future.

275
00:31:55,643 --> 00:31:59,917
The second reason is ideology.
Love of the fatherland.

276
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:04,118
It is more interesting,
but the dreamer cracks up.

277
00:32:04,282 --> 00:32:09,113
He is not strong enough.
He is too superficial.

278
00:32:11,803 --> 00:32:15,587
Youthful irresponsibility,
youthful arrogance.

279
00:32:15,762 --> 00:32:20,116
Unless he is burning.
Fanatic, if you like.

280
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:23,555
Then he will be a good soldier.

281
00:32:23,722 --> 00:32:29,155
- And the third reason?
- Hatred of the enemy.

282
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:32,834
Hatred seduces you,
get you to do things ...

283
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:36,549
... you never would have thought,
you were able to.

284
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:41,517
Something else is hatred
caused by a personal neurosis.

285
00:32:41,682 --> 00:32:43,273
What do you mean?

286
00:32:43,443 --> 00:32:47,478
The neurotic is intelligent,
and he is a doubter.

287
00:32:48,881 --> 00:32:53,554
If he is betrayed,
his hatred fades.

288
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:56,076
And the doubt wins.

289
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:01,391
War does not cater to
the neurotic.

290
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:07,389
The gentle, good father
is not found in war.

291
00:33:08,803 --> 00:33:12,758
Your struggle, Christensen,
is warranted.

292
00:33:12,922 --> 00:33:16,706
Now just be a good soldier.

293
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,270
Are you leaving already?

294
00:33:28,683 --> 00:33:30,433
It had to come to this.

295
00:33:31,403 --> 00:33:34,199
You make a serious mistake.

296
00:33:37,442 --> 00:33:41,227
Our Father, which art in heaven ...

297
00:33:41,402 --> 00:33:43,867
hallowed be thy name ...

298
00:34:03,122 --> 00:34:05,190
There is something wrong.

299
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:08,636
- What happened?
- Drive.

300
00:35:41,082 --> 00:35:42,878
Stop it.

301
00:35:47,043 --> 00:35:49,793
Quiet. Breathe.

302
00:35:54,962 --> 00:36:00,316
Bent, we will take you to
a private clinic.

303
00:36:00,482 --> 00:36:05,677
An order must be followed. Do you understand?
It is not for discussion.

304
00:36:05,843 --> 00:36:10,832
- Seibold was a hard nut.
- He is a trained soldier.

305
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:15,072
Mrs Lorentzen is dead
and Seibold is seriously injured.

306
00:36:15,243 --> 00:36:18,596
One out of three,
it's not good enough.

307
00:36:18,763 --> 00:36:22,593
Then you must do it yourself next time.

308
00:36:22,762 --> 00:36:25,557
I choose to ignore that.

309
00:36:30,642 --> 00:36:33,870
You shouldn't have engaged
in a conversation with Gilbert.

310
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:38,668
- He's not a Nazi. He admires our struggle.
- You think so?

311
00:36:38,841 --> 00:36:44,229
He will say anything.
Gilbert is incredibly gifted, isn't he?

312
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:49,267
He knew who you were,
and why you came. He played you.

313
00:36:49,442 --> 00:36:54,194
He has been laughing with his wife
since you left. He and Hoffman have laughed.

314
00:36:54,362 --> 00:36:56,998
It must not happen again.

315
00:36:57,162 --> 00:37:01,914
Sorry. Sorry.

316
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:06,114
Just make sure you survive.

317
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:12,314
I'm meeting Hoffmann in half an hour.
Bent left the papers with Gilbert.

318
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:15,915
Now Hoffman would
like an explanation.

319
00:37:36,842 --> 00:37:40,148
J¯rgen ... You have visitors.

320
00:37:56,362 --> 00:38:00,796
- Where is Anne?
- She is waiting outside.

321
00:38:00,963 --> 00:38:05,713
We've been looking for you. You promised,
you would come and fetch us.

322
00:38:08,322 --> 00:38:11,754
It is from you.
It is a book she wanted.

323
00:38:11,921 --> 00:38:15,548
- It is only on Monday.
- No, it is today.

324
00:38:20,482 --> 00:38:24,471
Should we have a party?
We usually have a small celebration.

325
00:38:24,641 --> 00:38:26,994
We can't afford it.

326
00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:29,832
You don't come with anything ...

327
00:38:30,002 --> 00:38:33,514
... and my dad will not help,
as long as I'm married to you.

328
00:38:35,961 --> 00:38:37,952
Wait a moment.

329
00:38:40,003 --> 00:38:43,709
I must borrow some money.
Now. Come on.

330
00:38:43,883 --> 00:38:46,190
Cough up.

331
00:38:46,362 --> 00:38:51,067
It's my daughter's birthday.
Come on.

332
00:38:56,161 --> 00:39:00,868
There is a merchant out by Runddelen.
He's a Nazi pig. Swims in cash.

333
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:03,792
I'm not a criminal.

334
00:39:05,202 --> 00:39:08,111
Stay away from him.
Even you, Little Bear.

335
00:40:06,201 --> 00:40:09,349
Run out and play with the yoyo
your father gave you.

336
00:40:15,801 --> 00:40:18,551
Sorry.

337
00:40:27,482 --> 00:40:30,516
She has learned to whistle?

338
00:40:32,122 --> 00:40:35,395
Much has happened.

339
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:50,024
I don't know how long I can
handle this. Do you understand?

340
00:40:56,721 --> 00:41:00,915
- Bodil, I'd like ...
- I don't want to go to Sweden.

341
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:03,434
- it's safer.
- it's safe here.

342
00:41:03,602 --> 00:41:07,273
I can't visit you here.
I can visit you in Sweden.

343
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:24,558
I love you.
You know that.

344
00:41:27,162 --> 00:41:30,071
It's just war.

345
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:37,912
It has nothing to do with war.
Before the war you were not at home either.

346
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:41,355
I sat and waited.

347
00:41:41,522 --> 00:41:44,352
It has nothing to do with the war.

348
00:41:46,522 --> 00:41:50,511
You're just not able to do it.

349
00:41:50,681 --> 00:41:54,069
You're not such a man.

350
00:42:24,722 --> 00:42:27,995
- Are they coming?
- I suppose so.

351
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:32,355
- You should know if they come.
- I should know, but I don't know.

352
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,195
Finally.

353
00:42:52,841 --> 00:42:56,546
Spex from the secret service.
Flammen and Citronen.

354
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,631
- Welcome to Stockholm.
- Thank you.

355
00:43:00,801 --> 00:43:02,994
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

356
00:43:03,922 --> 00:43:08,389
Three days ago Gestapo took revenge
for some attacks on German officers.

357
00:43:08,561 --> 00:43:13,755
They stopped a tram and threw
grenades at the 29 passengers.

358
00:43:13,922 --> 00:43:19,275
You can imagine the consequences.
If not, look inside the folder in front of you.

359
00:43:22,201 --> 00:43:25,827
Gestapo threatens more attacks
if the assassinations continue.

360
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:28,069
It's pure terror.

361
00:43:28,241 --> 00:43:32,435
Terror, which could have been avoided
if you had not attacked the Germans.

362
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:34,874
What are you talking about?

363
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:39,429
You may make Hoffmann
believe you're innocent ...

364
00:43:39,601 --> 00:43:42,987
... but we know that you ordered
the attacks on Gilbert ...

365
00:43:43,161 --> 00:43:45,161
... Mrs Lorentzen and Seibold.

366
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:48,834
I don't know what you're talking about.

367
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:52,503
- I am subject to English command ...
- English command?

368
00:43:52,698 --> 00:43:54,698
... and not accountable to either
the Freedom Council or the army.

369
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:57,711
What the hell are you talking about?

370
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,836
- Are you giving me crap?
- What is all this about?

371
00:44:07,722 --> 00:44:13,825
This is an order: Any reaction
to the tram attack is ruled out.

372
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:17,752
All the killings, all the sabotage
must cease immediately.

373
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:20,717
Communist cells
have received the same order.

374
00:44:20,881 --> 00:44:26,792
At least 50,000 armed men
are ready to fall the Germans in the back ...

375
00:44:26,961 --> 00:44:31,473
... if the allies land troops
on the West Coast. This is big.

376
00:44:31,641 --> 00:44:36,666
We need absolute peace
to form these secret groups.

377
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:41,513
I need to listen to
the 29 victims. They say only one thing:

378
00:44:42,922 --> 00:44:44,478
Revenge.

379
00:44:46,641 --> 00:44:50,517
From your national service in the fleet
and the army, Mr. Faurschou-Hviid ...

380
00:44:50,682 --> 00:44:53,035
Yes, please.

381
00:44:53,201 --> 00:44:59,065
... you may be aware of
the consequences of refusing orders.

382
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:02,833
- Is that a threat?
- You could interpret it as you will.

383
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:06,513
We are doing a great military effort.
Neither we ...

384
00:45:06,681 --> 00:45:12,034
... or England are interested in it being
destroyed by resistance groups.

385
00:45:12,201 --> 00:45:15,668
Our goal is to win the peace,
not to escalate the war.

386
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,875
I am bound by issued orders.

387
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,553
- Which was to execute Gilbert?
- Among others.

388
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:26,028
I will contact London and
find out who you work for.

389
00:45:26,201 --> 00:45:31,509
Until then follow the orders
issued from here. Understood?

390
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,432
- Fatherland.
- Fatherland.

391
00:45:50,322 --> 00:45:53,231
- Yes?
- It's Winther.

392
00:45:54,321 --> 00:45:58,469
Spex doesn't get it. He thinks he can
sit in Stockholm and determine everything.

393
00:46:00,401 --> 00:46:02,867
Is it us, they're watching?

394
00:46:04,521 --> 00:46:07,192
- Yes.
- Spex's team from the army?

395
00:46:07,361 --> 00:46:12,111
No. Spex is an idiot. it's the Swedish
security police. They're afraid of you.

396
00:46:12,281 --> 00:46:15,156
- What are they afraid of?
- That you will shoot someone in Sweden.

397
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:20,788
They don't want trouble with their
German friends. You're famous here.

398
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,147
It will be difficult
to get close to Gilbert.

399
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,594
Gestapo have put bodyguards on him.

400
00:46:35,762 --> 00:46:39,717
I can be ready in two weeks.
I will do what you come up with.

401
00:46:39,882 --> 00:46:44,156
- London wants action now.
- Now?

402
00:46:44,321 --> 00:46:49,266
Gilbert expands his operations.
He has become a big threat.

403
00:46:49,442 --> 00:46:52,636
- Can the Bears do?
- They're too noisy.

404
00:46:52,802 --> 00:46:57,552
This requires precision,
discretion and a little brain.

405
00:46:58,881 --> 00:47:04,235
I might hit him from the car.
If we can get close enough.

406
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,835
- It's too risky.
- I'll do it.

407
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,114
Shut up, J¯rgen.

408
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:55,464
- Cheers for J¯rgen.
- Cheers!

409
00:49:01,161 --> 00:49:03,628
I have closed.

410
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,555
I have closed.

411
00:49:22,601 --> 00:49:26,306
All right ... what do you want?

412
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:35,707
Would you like to live?
You Nazi pig.

413
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,032
Fill it up.

414
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,549
Eggs, flour, yeast, sugar ...

415
00:50:02,721 --> 00:50:04,835
Everything.

416
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,475
I see you have real coffee
for your friends in the party.

417
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,278
The apples look good.

418
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,914
- Is it real chocolate?
- Yes.

419
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,870
What the hell is that?

420
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,509
Who the hell do you think I am?
Do you think I have come to steal money?

421
00:50:51,001 --> 00:50:54,229
Do you think I am a thief?

422
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,309
- Are you saying I am a thief?!
- Sorry.

423
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,547
Thank you ...

424
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,190
- Good evening, J¯rgen.
- Good evening.

425
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:27,429
- You come home late.
- Yes.

426
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,714
Hello, darling.

427
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:35,546
Now see what Daddy bought for you.

428
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:40,187
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Thank you.

429
00:51:40,361 --> 00:51:45,477
And there're some dresses
you can just put on.

430
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:54,508
And this is for you.
That should last for a couple of days.

431
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:56,191
Thank you.

432
00:52:00,241 --> 00:52:03,196
Anne, go in and get ready for bed.

433
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,269
I will come and put you in bed
in a moment.

434
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:24,109
J¯rgen, there is something
I must tell you.

435
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,078
I have met somebody else.

436
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,069
You hear what I say?

437
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,628
It shouldn't have happened.
But it did.

438
00:52:46,241 --> 00:52:48,706
I'm sorry.

439
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,312
J¯rgen.

440
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,826
Don't.

441
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,591
- Who is it?
- It doesn't matter who it is.

442
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:04,464
- Who is it?
- You don't know him.

443
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:07,549
Who is it?!

444
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:11,505
God damn it, answer me.
Who is it?

445
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,913
Are you afraid of me?
Why the hell are you afraid of me?

446
00:54:20,081 --> 00:54:24,081
I've never done you any harm.
Have I done you any harm ever?

447
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,714
You'll kill him.

448
00:54:27,748 --> 00:54:32,154
If I tell you, you'll kill him.
It's the only thing you know how to do.

449
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:37,628
Why do you say that?
Why do you say that? What?

450
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:42,074
It's not true.
Why do you say that?

451
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,194
I love you.

452
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,591
Where did you go?

453
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,395
I was ...

454
00:55:49,239 --> 00:55:51,705
I was ...

455
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:59,435
- Can I try this one?
- Yes. Of course.

456
00:56:20,759 --> 00:56:24,352
You get more out of it
if you use single shots.

457
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:42,073
Aksel asks
if you want a trip to Sweden.

458
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,512
- To calm the nerves.
- Does he?

459
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:50,591
- Tell him my nerves are doing well.
- Keep it. It's a gift, J¯rgen.

460
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,431
I'll get another.

461
00:56:55,001 --> 00:56:57,512
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

462
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,834
We can take it to Japan.
When we're done with the Germans.

463
00:57:08,001 --> 00:57:11,273
We can go with the Americans to Japan.

464
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,715
- Flammen and Citronen in Japan?
- Precisely.

465
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:34,390
- And then?
- There is no "afterwards".

466
00:57:34,558 --> 00:57:37,707
Not here. Not for us.

467
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,151
I think we should proceed.

468
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,550
Up! Come on!

469
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:16,708
Up!

470
00:58:19,758 --> 00:58:22,351
Up!

471
00:58:32,598 --> 00:58:34,747
Fatherland!

472
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:46,155
A short while ago Gestapo executed
three of our comrades.

473
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:50,832
Bob, Carl and the teacher;
were gunned down in front of Dagmarhus.

474
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,234
There is a traitor
very close to us.

475
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,673
They were betrayed.
There's no doubt about that.

476
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:02,590
An hour ago there were
eight executions in Ryvangen.

477
00:59:02,759 --> 00:59:06,192
My contact says,
there will be eight more tonight.

478
00:59:06,359 --> 00:59:09,428
Hoffman strikes back hard
after the assassination of Gilbert.

479
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,622
The Communists have
sabotaged Riffelsyndikatet.

480
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:19,312
And an hour ago The Schalburg Corps
bombed Tivoli in retaliation.

481
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:27,271
Everything suggests several attacks,
more retaliations and more executions.

482
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:31,553
I will ask for a minute's silence
for our fallen comrades.

483
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:02,114
S¯ren, are you a bigamist?

484
01:00:02,278 --> 01:00:04,586
What?

485
01:00:04,759 --> 01:00:07,395
Do you sleep with others?

486
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:10,912
No. No, damn it.

487
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:13,988
I could never.

488
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:19,988
They were my friends.
We were in Finland together.

489
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,672
- Friends betray friends.
- Should I shoot him?

490
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:28,829
- I don't know yet.
- It wasn't me, damn it.

491
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,387
What actually happened
at Lauritz Betjent?

492
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:40,305
We were out to celebrate
the invasion of France.

493
01:00:42,678 --> 01:00:45,031
We stand by the bar.

494
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:48,950
Me and Little Bear and Big Bear.

495
01:00:50,678 --> 01:00:55,065
We turn to see
that Bob and Carl and the Wise ...

496
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:59,990
... have been surrounded
by the Gestapo.

497
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:03,704
There was nothing
else to do than ...

498
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,994
... to just sneak out, right?

499
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:09,387
What do the Bears say?

500
01:01:09,559 --> 01:01:12,754
It's true what he says.

501
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:16,704
About being at Lauritz Betjent.
It's true.

502
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:22,195
All right, S¯ren. Sorry.
But you know how it is.

503
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,586
Yes. You know how it is.

504
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:33,834
I need more time, but I will find the traitor.
Keep a low profile.

505
01:01:33,999 --> 01:01:36,750
There's an uprising in Vesterbro.

506
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,465
Where were you?

507
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,865
Where were you,
when the popular uprising broke out?

508
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:56,630
Where were you on 26 June ...

509
01:01:56,798 --> 01:01:59,026
... when Copenhagen rose?

510
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,308
Finally the people had had enough.

511
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,991
Finally, they did something.

512
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,954
Now we are close.

513
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:15,153
War.

514
01:02:17,319 --> 01:02:19,877
There are 32 dead ...

515
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:22,596
... and it has just begun.

516
01:02:22,759 --> 01:02:26,385
The Communists are fighting.

517
01:02:31,479 --> 01:02:34,388
We just wait.

518
01:02:56,759 --> 01:02:59,112
Hello, Ketty.

519
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:03,708
How did you come in?

520
01:03:03,879 --> 01:03:08,665
- It's my birthday today.
- Should I sing for you?

521
01:03:08,839 --> 01:03:12,510
No.
I would like to invite you to dinner.

522
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:15,953
- Who sent you?
- No one.

523
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:24,947
Hoffman has just declared you to
to be the German's enemy number 1.

524
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,949
The reward is 20,000 kroner,
and you break into my room?

525
01:03:29,118 --> 01:03:34,064
There is trouble and insurrection out in the street,
and you want to eat.

526
01:03:34,238 --> 01:03:38,944
- Are you crazy?
- All right. Sorry. I will come.

527
01:03:42,478 --> 01:03:47,230
You must be careful.
We have to cover your hair.

528
01:03:47,399 --> 01:03:49,957
Here.

529
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:07,355
- What did you do before the war?
- All kinds of things.

530
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:11,633
- I danced at a time.
- You danced?

531
01:04:11,799 --> 01:04:14,391
Where?

532
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,787
At the Apollo Theater.

533
01:04:17,959 --> 01:04:20,232
It was fun.

534
01:04:20,399 --> 01:04:23,274
It was not pretty,
but it was fun.

535
01:04:23,439 --> 01:04:27,792
And I met many people.
It was there, I met Winther.

536
01:04:34,038 --> 01:04:39,267
Winther has helped me.
He got me a place to live and work.

537
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,746
He is a great man.

538
01:04:41,918 --> 01:04:44,272
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

539
01:04:47,479 --> 01:04:51,514
- Why do you do it?
- Do what?

540
01:04:52,679 --> 01:04:54,907
Kill so many.

541
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:04,273
- Someone has to do it.
- Yes, but why kill?

542
01:05:04,439 --> 01:05:07,269
What can we do?

543
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:13,751
I was sent to Germany
in 1940 by my father ...

544
01:05:13,919 --> 01:05:16,669
... to learn to
serve and cook.

545
01:05:17,999 --> 01:05:21,272
The director of the place
where I worked, was a Nazi.

546
01:05:21,438 --> 01:05:23,995
The chef was a Nazi.

547
01:05:24,158 --> 01:05:26,670
Several of the servants were Nazis.

548
01:05:26,838 --> 01:05:30,749
Each day I served them.
Everywhere.

549
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:37,069
A girl who worked at the hotel,
she was a Jew. Nobody knew it.

550
01:05:37,239 --> 01:05:39,671
She kept it secret.

551
01:05:41,118 --> 01:05:43,949
The chef found out.

552
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:46,347
He informed on her.

553
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:52,384
She was beaten to pulp by the time
the police came to fetch her.

554
01:05:54,399 --> 01:05:57,594
It must not happen here.

555
01:05:57,758 --> 01:06:00,952
Sabotage means nothing.

556
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:05,108
The only thing to do
is to remove them. One by one.

557
01:06:06,478 --> 01:06:09,547
Until there is no one left.

558
01:06:11,478 --> 01:06:14,115
Was she your girlfriend?

559
01:06:17,238 --> 01:06:20,033
What happened to her?

560
01:06:24,838 --> 01:06:27,589
- What about you?
- I don't know.

561
01:06:27,759 --> 01:06:31,305
I was very happy when the war came.
It was a relief.

562
01:06:31,479 --> 01:06:34,866
Because finally one
could do something right.

563
01:06:35,038 --> 01:06:37,788
I worked for Winther.

564
01:06:37,959 --> 01:06:43,075
Delivered letters and got
information and passed it on.

565
01:06:46,438 --> 01:06:49,632
It was fun in the beginning.

566
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:52,787
But now it's different.

567
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:55,709
Everything is gray.

568
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:01,747
I just want to survive.

569
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:09,066
Do you know what I think?

570
01:07:09,237 --> 01:07:13,352
I think we should leave quietly.

571
01:07:30,598 --> 01:07:33,668
There is one thing you must promise me.

572
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:37,305
You should never use me to
to obtain information.

573
01:07:37,478 --> 01:07:42,229
You should never ask me about that.
It should not come between us.

574
01:07:42,398 --> 01:07:45,910
- Promise me?
- Yes.

575
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:52,713
I wish that the war would stop soon.

576
01:07:56,078 --> 01:07:59,590
Why can't I get out of this?

577
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:04,551
I wish I could just go away.

578
01:08:06,758 --> 01:08:09,396
Where would you go?

579
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,871
To Stockholm.

580
01:08:21,678 --> 01:08:25,463
The war doesn't stop.

581
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:30,472
- Don't be afraid.
- Should I not?

582
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,433
I will look after you.

583
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:43,112
- Will you?
- Yes.

584
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,552
My name is J¯rgen.

585
01:09:08,599 --> 01:09:11,633
Do you have time to talk to me?

586
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:27,149
What is your name?

587
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:30,664
Morten.

588
01:09:34,318 --> 01:09:38,547
You must take good care
of my wife and my daughter.

589
01:09:39,558 --> 01:09:42,752
- Yes.
- Do you have a job?

590
01:09:43,798 --> 01:09:47,390
- Do you make money?
- Yes.

591
01:09:56,919 --> 01:10:01,033
Morten,
you must be good to my daughter.

592
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:04,472
If I ever hear anything else ...

593
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:08,590
... then I will return.

594
01:10:08,759 --> 01:10:12,430
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

595
01:10:50,358 --> 01:10:52,951
Here is coffee.

596
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:02,473
You have gotten a hat.

597
01:11:09,358 --> 01:11:11,312
That's good.

598
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:29,783
- The reward for you is 20,000.
- I know.

599
01:11:29,958 --> 01:11:33,629
It may tempt many.
A wise move by Hoffmann.

600
01:11:33,797 --> 01:11:36,868
- Give me the order to shoot him.
- No.

601
01:11:38,839 --> 01:11:42,272
I have something else for you.
The traitor.

602
01:11:43,998 --> 01:11:48,545
Unfortunately it's from our own ranks.
Madam Ketty Selmer Sjˆberg.

603
01:11:51,079 --> 01:11:53,465
She must be liquidated.

604
01:11:58,717 --> 01:12:01,229
- You're wrong.
- Am I?

605
01:12:01,398 --> 01:12:03,591
I know her.

606
01:12:03,758 --> 01:12:05,748
She is a courier.

607
01:12:05,918 --> 01:12:09,703
- Former dancing girl.
- Yes. I know all about Ketty.

608
01:12:09,878 --> 01:12:14,072
She is my courier.
She knows everything there is to know.

609
01:12:14,237 --> 01:12:16,794
We must strike now.

610
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:20,186
Why has she not betrayed Bent?

611
01:12:20,358 --> 01:12:24,347
Why betray Carl and the Wise,
when she could get 20,000 for Bent?

612
01:12:24,518 --> 01:12:27,667
You should ask Bent about that.

613
01:12:27,838 --> 01:12:31,383
She is a double agent
and feels no loyalty.

614
01:12:31,557 --> 01:12:37,105
Hoffman has caught her,
and then she has given him information.

615
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:40,109
She has gone too far.

616
01:12:44,758 --> 01:12:46,872
Should I do it?

617
01:12:49,038 --> 01:12:50,992
No.

618
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:13,068
Bent?
What are you doing here?

619
01:14:14,358 --> 01:14:17,028
It's nice to see you.

620
01:14:18,438 --> 01:14:20,711
Sit down.

621
01:14:38,277 --> 01:14:41,027
Who do you work for?

622
01:14:42,918 --> 01:14:46,749
- Winther, of course.
- Try again.

623
01:14:48,437 --> 01:14:51,347
- Who asked you to draw me?
- Nobody.

624
01:14:51,517 --> 01:14:54,392
Why this?

625
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:58,943
I sat and thought of you.

626
01:15:00,877 --> 01:15:05,948
- Why do you go to Dagmarhus?
- I must have my passport stamped.

627
01:15:06,119 --> 01:15:08,108
So I can travel.

628
01:15:08,278 --> 01:15:10,506
See here.

629
01:15:10,678 --> 01:15:13,747
- There. Visa.
- Who are you working for?

630
01:15:13,917 --> 01:15:17,794
- I can't say.
- Who are you working for?

631
01:15:24,158 --> 01:15:27,510
I work for
the army's intelligence service.

632
01:15:27,677 --> 01:15:30,064
And Winther.

633
01:15:31,358 --> 01:15:34,313
I bring documents back and forth.

634
01:15:34,477 --> 01:15:38,022
I solve tasks for them.
I am under orders.

635
01:15:38,197 --> 01:15:41,789
You betrayed them.
Didn't you?

636
01:15:41,957 --> 01:15:44,991
Why did you betray them?

637
01:15:45,157 --> 01:15:48,749
- Why did you betray them?
- What's this?

638
01:15:48,917 --> 01:15:52,190
- How much did you get for it?
- Who says so?

639
01:15:52,357 --> 01:15:54,551
Is it Winther?

640
01:15:56,598 --> 01:15:59,746
He is a trickster.
He is a swindler.

641
01:15:59,917 --> 01:16:03,225
Be careful what you say.
He is subject to London.

642
01:16:03,397 --> 01:16:07,830
- London? They don't want him.
- It's not true.

643
01:16:07,998 --> 01:16:12,146
- He receives orders ...
- Yes, but not from the English.

644
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:15,352
Let me show you something.

645
01:16:16,998 --> 01:16:22,350
These are copies of contracts
Winther made with Gilbert.

646
01:16:26,278 --> 01:16:29,666
I also have copies of them
in Stockholm.

647
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:37,423
Winther was Gilbert's
legal adviser for years.

648
01:16:37,597 --> 01:16:41,143
They did business together
and earned a lot of money.

649
01:16:41,316 --> 01:16:46,468
A lot of money, Bent.
Winther must have realized that ...

650
01:16:46,638 --> 01:16:51,583
... his business with Gilbert
would be considered treason.

651
01:16:51,758 --> 01:16:55,064
Gilbert was a senior German officer.

652
01:16:55,237 --> 01:17:00,591
When the war ends, Winther would
be accused of profiteering.

653
01:17:00,758 --> 01:17:04,588
His relationship with Seibold
would also be examined.

654
01:17:04,758 --> 01:17:10,987
He would go to prison. He
had to get them out of the way.

655
01:17:11,156 --> 01:17:14,863
Both Gilbert and Seibold.

656
01:17:15,038 --> 01:17:17,595
And he used you for that.

657
01:17:22,278 --> 01:17:26,347
- These are forgeries.
- No, the papers are genuine enough.

658
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:29,984
Winther is a gangster.
I know too much.

659
01:17:30,157 --> 01:17:34,749
- Now, I must also be eliminated.
- They were German spies.

660
01:17:34,917 --> 01:17:37,508
German spies? No.

661
01:17:37,677 --> 01:17:41,508
Gilbert and Mrs Lorentzen
were German resistance fighters.

662
01:17:43,918 --> 01:17:48,749
Seibold was a spy.
But you never got him, did you?

663
01:17:55,397 --> 01:18:00,263
Gilbert was an expert at fooling people.
He had bodyguards from the Gestapo ...

664
01:18:00,437 --> 01:18:02,790
It wasn't bodyguards.

665
01:18:02,957 --> 01:18:07,105
Gilbert was under house arrest,
suspected of anti-Nazi activities.

666
01:18:07,277 --> 01:18:12,107
If Hoffman wanted to protect Gilbert,
you would not have come near him.

667
01:18:12,276 --> 01:18:15,108
Is Hoffman sorry for Gilbert's death?

668
01:18:15,276 --> 01:18:19,424
- No. you have done him a favor.
- And Mrs Lorentzen?

669
01:18:19,596 --> 01:18:23,904
She was Gilbert's secretary and knows
about his business with Winther.

670
01:18:24,076 --> 01:18:27,224
She was committed
to the resistance against Hitler.

671
01:18:27,397 --> 01:18:32,228
But most of all, she was just a sweet,
little lady who got caught between two men.

672
01:18:32,398 --> 01:18:34,671
And Winther ... ?

673
01:18:36,397 --> 01:18:39,704
Does Winther work for the Gestapo?

674
01:18:39,877 --> 01:18:42,912
No.
He just cleans up his tracks.

675
01:19:00,957 --> 01:19:03,957
- Is Winther here?
- Go away!

676
01:19:03,993 --> 01:19:08,589
Winther has fled to Stockholm.
They have exposed everything.

677
01:19:08,757 --> 01:19:11,109
Go away, damn it!

678
01:19:55,516 --> 01:20:00,029
He was right. Winther is gone.
He has bolted.

679
01:20:00,196 --> 01:20:03,105
We have shot innocent people.

680
01:20:03,277 --> 01:20:06,869
Aksel never worked
for the English.

681
01:20:07,036 --> 01:20:12,504
Anyone who knew anything, they should
be executed. He lacked only Ketty.

682
01:20:12,677 --> 01:20:16,031
- We have shot innocent ...
- Shut up!

683
01:20:16,197 --> 01:20:18,186
Shut up.

684
01:20:18,357 --> 01:20:22,665
I have not killed innocent people.

685
01:20:27,158 --> 01:20:33,069
I've shot a German officer,
and a German officer is not innocent.

686
01:20:33,237 --> 01:20:37,703
You tell me that he was a
resistance man? Are you an idiot?

687
01:20:37,876 --> 01:20:43,788
Winther! What did you expect?
That's the way rich people are.

688
01:20:43,957 --> 01:20:48,310
In a nutshell. They grab and
are full of crap.

689
01:20:51,476 --> 01:20:54,510
You should have killed her
when you first met her.

690
01:20:54,676 --> 01:20:57,188
What are you talking about?

691
01:20:57,357 --> 01:21:00,505
- She messes up your head.
- Beware!

692
01:21:00,677 --> 01:21:03,780
A slut knows the real names,
and you're completely lost.

693
01:21:03,784 --> 01:21:06,285
You fuck her, and she turns into
the Oracle of Vesterbro.

694
01:21:06,356 --> 01:21:10,230
- Shut up.
- I say what I want to say.

695
01:21:10,397 --> 01:21:14,750
And I have not killed any
innocent people. Do you understand that?

696
01:21:38,798 --> 01:21:41,389
Why didn't I see it?

697
01:21:42,557 --> 01:21:45,830
Why didn't I see it happen?

698
01:21:45,997 --> 01:21:48,349
Now he sits in Stockholm ...

699
01:21:48,516 --> 01:21:52,903
... while we're being chased
throughout the city by the Gestapo.

700
01:21:55,156 --> 01:21:58,544
Is that fair?

701
01:21:58,717 --> 01:22:02,991
There is nothing that is fair or unfair.
This is war.

702
01:22:04,917 --> 01:22:09,032
We find the ones we want to go after,
and then we go after them.

703
01:22:18,116 --> 01:22:20,230
- Hoffmann.
- Yes.

704
01:22:54,997 --> 01:22:58,748
Come. Come!

705
01:23:02,237 --> 01:23:04,272
Come on, boys.

706
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:29,990
- Quiet.
- Where is he?

707
01:23:30,156 --> 01:23:32,463
- Where is he?
- Back room.

708
01:23:46,077 --> 01:23:48,031
Flammen?

709
01:23:54,997 --> 01:23:57,634
I have an offer for you.

710
01:23:59,476 --> 01:24:02,034
You leave this place,
so do I.

711
01:24:02,197 --> 01:24:04,833
I stop the hunt for you
for 24 hours.

712
01:24:04,996 --> 01:24:09,907
You go to Sweden and remain there till
the war is over, and this conversation ...

713
01:24:10,077 --> 01:24:13,225
... has never taken place.

714
01:24:24,916 --> 01:24:28,383
Have you thought about
the consequences?

715
01:24:28,556 --> 01:24:31,272
If you liquidate the Gestapo chief.

716
01:24:31,436 --> 01:24:36,143
Do you want to survive the war?
- I will survive.

717
01:24:36,317 --> 01:24:40,591
That would surprise me.
Survival is not part of your character.

718
01:24:40,757 --> 01:24:45,543
You are a fanatic and a terrorist.
They always die.

719
01:24:50,517 --> 01:24:52,870
Tell me ...

720
01:24:53,037 --> 01:24:57,390
... do you really believe that you can
change anything with all your shooting?

721
01:24:57,556 --> 01:25:02,671
Can't you see, you are just a tool
for others with not so noble motives?

722
01:25:02,836 --> 01:25:10,020
I thought you were the brain
behind all these heroic actions.

723
01:25:10,196 --> 01:25:12,105
But no, it was Winther!

724
01:25:12,276 --> 01:25:18,107
How could you take him seriously?
He is completely untrustworthy.

725
01:25:19,636 --> 01:25:21,909
And now you will take over.

726
01:25:22,077 --> 01:25:26,511
You were betrayed, and now
the Gestapo chief must suffer for it. Why?

727
01:25:26,677 --> 01:25:29,552
What would it change?

728
01:25:35,317 --> 01:25:37,909
We two are alike.

729
01:25:40,036 --> 01:25:43,264
I love Denmark.

730
01:25:43,437 --> 01:25:45,868
You love Denmark.

731
01:25:47,557 --> 01:25:51,229
The beautiful landscape
in the North of Zealand.

732
01:25:51,397 --> 01:25:54,625
Why don't we collaborate?

733
01:25:56,436 --> 01:26:00,426
You are right. The National Socialist
idea was nice, but impossible.

734
01:26:00,596 --> 01:26:05,462
Too many emotions.
Like an infatuation.

735
01:26:05,636 --> 01:26:08,591
See what the idea
has done to the world.

736
01:26:08,757 --> 01:26:11,712
But consider me as a possibility.

737
01:26:11,876 --> 01:26:15,229
I have abandoned my ideals.
I must survive.

738
01:26:15,395 --> 01:26:19,023
And I also want you to survive.

739
01:26:19,197 --> 01:26:21,345
What do you say?

740
01:26:27,396 --> 01:26:30,032
I understand you.

741
01:26:32,716 --> 01:26:34,910
Excellent.

742
01:26:36,037 --> 01:26:37,991
I count to three.

743
01:26:40,037 --> 01:26:42,071
One.

744
01:26:42,236 --> 01:26:44,872
Two.

745
01:26:45,036 --> 01:26:47,309
Now comes the police ...

746
01:26:47,476 --> 01:26:51,182
... or what is worse for you,
German soldiers.

747
01:26:51,356 --> 01:26:54,663
Will you wait
till you are surrounded?

748
01:27:05,036 --> 01:27:07,070
What happened?

749
01:27:08,035 --> 01:27:09,991
What happened?

750
01:27:32,437 --> 01:27:35,313
- You got my message?
- Yes.

751
01:27:36,716 --> 01:27:40,149
- You have brought people.
- So have you.

752
01:27:40,316 --> 01:27:43,544
Yes. It's Spex.
He doesn't trust you.

753
01:27:45,956 --> 01:27:49,866
I have a message.
I need an answer back.

754
01:27:50,036 --> 01:27:53,786
There's a meeting in Stockholm
the day after tomorrow at 10 a.m.

755
01:27:53,955 --> 01:27:57,547
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

756
01:27:59,556 --> 01:28:01,510
Who is coming?

757
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:04,871
Spex and a representative
from the Freedom Council ...

758
01:28:05,036 --> 01:28:07,753
... and Winther.

759
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:09,870
- Aksel?
- Yes.

760
01:28:10,036 --> 01:28:12,911
His problems have been sorted out.

761
01:28:17,396 --> 01:28:20,271
I'm not coming.

762
01:28:20,437 --> 01:28:22,744
You will, Bent.

763
01:28:24,917 --> 01:28:29,225
You must go and talk to them
and hear what they have to say.

764
01:28:29,395 --> 01:28:32,783
It's important. Do you understand?

765
01:28:35,156 --> 01:28:38,781
I asked for permission to
give you this message.

766
01:28:41,035 --> 01:28:43,388
Because I wanted to see you.

767
01:28:43,555 --> 01:28:47,340
- I wanted to see that you're doing well.
- I'm fine.

768
01:28:57,196 --> 01:29:00,743
I will tell them you're coming.

769
01:29:07,077 --> 01:29:09,508
- Good evening.
- You're back with Winther, Bears?

770
01:29:09,675 --> 01:29:13,869
No, we're in the army now.
They pay well.

771
01:29:14,035 --> 01:29:17,866
We must unfortunately
confiscate your equipment.

772
01:29:23,235 --> 01:29:25,542
It's an honor.

773
01:29:27,275 --> 01:29:31,390
I represent the Freedom Council.
You can call me Raven.

774
01:29:31,555 --> 01:29:34,545
You know Spex
and Aksel Winther.

775
01:29:38,914 --> 01:29:42,745
The police lawyer is representing
the U.S. armed forces.

776
01:29:42,915 --> 01:29:45,791
Interesting.

777
01:29:46,836 --> 01:29:49,711
I will begin with something pleasant.

778
01:29:49,877 --> 01:29:53,912
We are close to a breakthrough
in negotiations with the Germans ...

779
01:29:54,076 --> 01:29:58,429
... for a termination
of the popular uprising.

780
01:29:58,595 --> 01:30:02,949
It will be a major victory for the people.
The curfew will be repealed.

781
01:30:03,117 --> 01:30:07,469
- The Schalburg Corps will be pulled out ...
- If law and order is maintained.

782
01:30:07,636 --> 01:30:10,545
Are you listening?

783
01:30:12,476 --> 01:30:16,988
Is everyone here aware of
what police lawyer has done?

784
01:30:18,516 --> 01:30:23,063
He has ordered us to liquidate
innocent people. Old friends.

785
01:30:23,235 --> 01:30:25,986
- They got in his way.
- What are you talking about?

786
01:30:26,155 --> 01:30:29,781
I have worked hard to get the
nation on the Allied side.

787
01:30:29,956 --> 01:30:35,105
- Old friends, Flammen?
- Gilbert, German resistance man.

788
01:30:35,275 --> 01:30:41,028
- Ketty Selmer, Danish courier.
- A German opposition man?

789
01:30:41,195 --> 01:30:45,106
Bent, my boy. The allies do not recognize
any German resistance movement.

790
01:30:45,277 --> 01:30:47,425
It doesn't exist.

791
01:30:47,596 --> 01:30:54,382
Madam Selmer was a regrettable error,
as the police lawyer explained.

792
01:30:54,555 --> 01:30:57,510
A simple misunderstanding ...

793
01:30:59,957 --> 01:31:03,992
A misunderstanding ... Excuse me.
A misunderstanding?

794
01:31:04,157 --> 01:31:07,862
So when I shoot you in the head
in a minute ...

795
01:31:08,036 --> 01:31:10,786
... it will be a regrettable error.

796
01:31:11,954 --> 01:31:13,944
Do we agree on that?

797
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:17,943
I ...

798
01:31:18,115 --> 01:31:21,388
... admire you, Flammen.

799
01:31:21,555 --> 01:31:27,546
But the war can be confusing,
as you may have discovered.

800
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:30,592
It's filled with rumors.

801
01:31:30,756 --> 01:31:33,871
The only sensible ...

802
01:31:34,036 --> 01:31:37,026
... is to keep a cool head.

803
01:31:38,195 --> 01:31:42,265
The Freedom Council knows nothing
about the killing of innocents ...

804
01:31:42,436 --> 01:31:45,982
... so if you allow ...

805
01:31:46,156 --> 01:31:49,270
... can we continue the meeting.

806
01:31:49,436 --> 01:31:52,550
- Are you a Communist, Faurschou?
- No.

807
01:31:52,715 --> 01:31:56,670
We can offer you
an officer's commission.

808
01:31:56,835 --> 01:32:00,745
You can get command of
the Copenhagen resistance unit.

809
01:32:00,916 --> 01:32:03,711
- And the rank of captain.
- Captain.

810
01:32:03,876 --> 01:32:06,308
Exactly, Bent. Think about it.

811
01:32:06,475 --> 01:32:10,510
You will either fight
side by side with the English ...

812
01:32:10,675 --> 01:32:15,029
... or you will fight against
the Red Army, if they comes first.

813
01:32:15,195 --> 01:32:19,389
Democracy must survive.
We would like to make use of your name.

814
01:32:19,555 --> 01:32:24,068
- My name? How?
- We'll need heroes.

815
01:32:24,236 --> 01:32:26,828
Lectures in schools and associations.

816
01:32:26,996 --> 01:32:30,303
Public speaking
to crowds of thousands ...

817
01:32:30,476 --> 01:32:34,147
... to understand the
unselfish sacrifice during the occupation.

818
01:32:34,315 --> 01:32:37,782
Which both of you are
outstanding exponents of.

819
01:32:42,996 --> 01:32:47,144
- What about J¯rgen?
- Deputy Commander. Lieutenant?

820
01:32:48,835 --> 01:32:53,859
- What were you going to be?
- Captain.

821
01:32:54,035 --> 01:32:57,342
Then I would also like to be a captain.

822
01:32:57,515 --> 01:32:59,311
No, thanks.

823
01:32:59,475 --> 01:33:04,624
We will no longer tolerate the disruptive
violence that the two of you engage in.

824
01:33:04,794 --> 01:33:08,830
When there is war,
you kill your opponents.

825
01:33:08,994 --> 01:33:12,905
I want Hoffmann. Then we can
talk about an officer's commission.

826
01:33:13,075 --> 01:33:16,032
- Impossible.
- I respect your position.

827
01:33:16,197 --> 01:33:19,902
But Hoffman ...

828
01:33:20,076 --> 01:33:22,712
- That won't do any good.
- We will see.

829
01:33:22,875 --> 01:33:27,627
We have the means and powers to
stop you in other ways.

830
01:33:29,797 --> 01:33:34,071
I apologize on Spex's behalf.
That was inappropriate.

831
01:33:35,835 --> 01:33:40,269
The file contains the name
of an informer in your organization.

832
01:33:40,436 --> 01:33:43,425
- How far are we going?
- Asserbo.

833
01:33:43,596 --> 01:33:47,141
Consider it an expression
of our good will.

834
01:33:48,756 --> 01:33:54,189
- Do you have a picture?
- No. We have his name and address.

835
01:33:59,115 --> 01:34:02,468
- I must pee.
- Yes, me too.

836
01:34:30,956 --> 01:34:32,945
Sorry.

837
01:35:00,516 --> 01:35:02,981
What will happen now?

838
01:35:03,155 --> 01:35:05,792
I will speak with my father.

839
01:35:08,275 --> 01:35:11,629
- When were you here last time?
- Three years.

840
01:35:14,596 --> 01:35:16,789
Just wait here.

841
01:35:44,795 --> 01:35:46,749
Hello, Dad.

842
01:35:59,995 --> 01:36:02,382
A glass of wine?

843
01:36:06,715 --> 01:36:12,024
- What are you here for?
- To visit my father.

844
01:36:12,196 --> 01:36:15,946
Let's not exaggerate.
What do you want?

845
01:36:16,994 --> 01:36:19,745
You have many German guests.

846
01:36:19,914 --> 01:36:23,541
Guests choose the hotel.
Not vice versa.

847
01:36:23,715 --> 01:36:28,261
- We heard Hoffman comes here.
- The Gestapo chief?

848
01:36:28,435 --> 01:36:32,549
- I can't tell.
- I want to talk to him.

849
01:36:33,874 --> 01:36:38,149
He is said to be very nice ...

850
01:36:38,315 --> 01:36:43,783
- And a murderer for an occupying power.
- Yes, that, too.

851
01:36:45,676 --> 01:36:50,109
- You like them?
- Them?

852
01:36:50,275 --> 01:36:54,981
German culture and everything wonderful,
it has generated, I admire.

853
01:36:55,156 --> 01:36:57,588
But "them"? No.

854
01:36:57,755 --> 01:37:00,391
It must disappoint you,
that the war is turning.

855
01:37:00,555 --> 01:37:05,385
Don't you listen to what I say?
I'm just trying to scrape through.

856
01:37:07,755 --> 01:37:10,313
You are too young to understand.

857
01:37:10,475 --> 01:37:13,545
With your background and your head ...

858
01:37:13,714 --> 01:37:17,226
... you could have gone further
than shooting people down.

859
01:37:19,955 --> 01:37:22,751
But then you became a hero.

860
01:37:28,155 --> 01:37:30,541
Listen.

861
01:37:31,914 --> 01:37:35,427
If you talk nicely about me
to your Communist friends ...

862
01:37:35,595 --> 01:37:41,347
... and don't shoot Hoffmann here,
then I will tell you what I know.

863
01:37:42,395 --> 01:37:44,782
Is that a deal?

864
01:38:04,915 --> 01:38:09,190
Hoffmann comes here with his family
and his mistresses.

865
01:38:11,555 --> 01:38:17,101
There are always four bodyguards,
who keep watch at the room.

866
01:38:22,234 --> 01:38:26,543
I don't know in advance
when he arrives.

867
01:39:14,835 --> 01:39:18,381
Army Intelligence
asked me to get close to him.

868
01:39:18,555 --> 01:39:20,829
I just follow orders.

869
01:39:20,996 --> 01:39:26,111
My dear Ketty. Thank you for yesterday.
You were lovely.

870
01:39:27,714 --> 01:39:30,465
Your laughter makes me so happy.

871
01:39:32,515 --> 01:39:35,107
Your Karl Heinz.

872
01:39:35,275 --> 01:39:38,264
You're on first names.

873
01:39:41,275 --> 01:39:44,070
This is not about you and me.

874
01:39:44,235 --> 01:39:49,703
This is bigger. My work requires
sacrifices. They ask for something. I'll do it.

875
01:39:49,875 --> 01:39:53,148
Did they ask you
to go to bed with me?

876
01:39:53,314 --> 01:39:56,940
No.
Of course they didn't.

877
01:39:58,874 --> 01:40:03,705
- You and me just happened.
- Did it?

878
01:40:09,755 --> 01:40:13,631
Bent, listen here.
Hoffmann means nothing.

879
01:40:15,674 --> 01:40:18,664
It's you that matters.

880
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:23,027
Do you understand that?

881
01:40:32,274 --> 01:40:37,902
Now tell me which car he
drives and the route he follows.

882
01:40:38,075 --> 01:40:42,030
- And the car's license plate.
- You must not ask me.

883
01:40:42,195 --> 01:40:45,740
You promised you would not
ask me about anything.

884
01:40:46,913 --> 01:40:48,744
You promised me.

885
01:40:53,754 --> 01:40:55,152
Bent ...

886
01:40:55,314 --> 01:40:58,826
I love you.
Do you understand that?

887
01:40:58,994 --> 01:41:01,789
No one has an interest in this.

888
01:41:06,834 --> 01:41:10,062
If I tell you ...

889
01:41:11,515 --> 01:41:14,629
... will you take me with
you to Stockholm?

890
01:41:16,074 --> 01:41:19,984
We go to Stockholm,
and we never return.

891
01:41:20,155 --> 01:41:22,985
Promise me?

892
01:41:24,274 --> 01:41:26,786
Promise me that.

893
01:41:30,914 --> 01:41:36,268
He drives a small, black
Opel Cadet. In odd weeks.

894
01:41:36,434 --> 01:41:39,628
23345.

895
01:41:39,794 --> 01:41:45,261
In even weeks, it's a big Mercedes.
44193.

896
01:41:45,433 --> 01:41:47,946
The route changes.

897
01:41:49,113 --> 01:41:52,182
Sometimes Roskildevej ...

898
01:41:52,354 --> 01:41:55,072
... and sometimes Vigerslevvej.

899
01:43:25,834 --> 01:43:29,460
It's not Hoffmann.

900
01:43:33,034 --> 01:43:35,421
Oh, no!

901
01:43:55,354 --> 01:43:57,468
You'll be fine.

902
01:43:57,634 --> 01:44:00,510
You'll be fine.
Don't be afraid.

903
01:44:00,675 --> 01:44:03,391
You'll be fine.

904
01:44:29,554 --> 01:44:31,272
Dear Bent,

905
01:44:31,435 --> 01:44:34,787
Hoffman has exposed me.

906
01:44:34,954 --> 01:44:37,750
I'm going to Stockholm now.

907
01:44:37,913 --> 01:44:41,698
I hope and believe
that you will come to me.

908
01:44:51,275 --> 01:44:53,343
He is dead.

909
01:45:14,274 --> 01:45:16,910
He looked at me all the time.

910
01:45:17,073 --> 01:45:21,063
He looked at me,
while I ran with him.

911
01:45:24,115 --> 01:45:28,230
I could see,
he wanted to say something, but ...

912
01:45:29,915 --> 01:45:32,473
... he could not.

913
01:45:36,434 --> 01:45:40,105
I didn't even get there
before he died.

914
01:46:05,473 --> 01:46:08,985
Do you still have the police uniforms?

915
01:46:12,114 --> 01:46:15,661
We go to Dagmarhus
and ask for a meeting with Hoffman.

916
01:46:15,835 --> 01:46:17,312
We must.

917
01:46:17,474 --> 01:46:21,941
We will never get in.
If we get in, we will never come out again.

918
01:46:22,114 --> 01:46:24,307
Come, come, come.

919
01:46:25,473 --> 01:46:27,429
Thank you. Go on. Come.

920
01:46:31,954 --> 01:46:34,830
Damn it.

921
01:46:34,993 --> 01:46:38,778
I thought they had
been pulled out of the city.

922
01:46:43,714 --> 01:46:45,509
Stop! Stop!

923
01:46:45,674 --> 01:46:48,345
Out of the car!

924
01:46:48,514 --> 01:46:51,503
Come on out. Can't you hear?
On the ground. Come on!

925
01:46:51,674 --> 01:46:53,742
On the ground!!

926
01:46:59,793 --> 01:47:01,668
Up in the cart.

927
01:47:01,833 --> 01:47:03,947
Turn around.

928
01:47:07,713 --> 01:47:10,670
Come on.
Get up.

929
01:47:17,674 --> 01:47:20,140
Come on!

930
01:47:23,073 --> 01:47:26,461
Come on, damn it.
Move on!

931
01:47:26,635 --> 01:47:30,590
Put these two down at the end.
Get up against the wall.

932
01:47:32,713 --> 01:47:36,782
Look at the wall. Everyone should have
a meter between your feet.

933
01:47:37,473 --> 01:47:41,225
- What's going on?
- They have taken the entire corps.

934
01:47:41,394 --> 01:47:45,065
We're going to the concentration camps.
It's the goddamn thanks.

935
01:47:47,793 --> 01:47:50,987
- Do you still have your baby Browning?
- In the boots.

936
01:47:51,153 --> 01:47:52,665
- And you?
- Yes.

937
01:47:54,393 --> 01:47:58,225
In a while I will jump over
the fence, and then you run.

938
01:48:05,394 --> 01:48:07,781
See you, Bent.

939
01:48:20,874 --> 01:48:23,591
Back in line down there!

940
01:48:37,472 --> 01:48:39,428
Get an ambulance!

941
01:48:39,593 --> 01:48:42,503
Get him out of here!

942
01:49:00,914 --> 01:49:03,346
Water.

943
01:49:04,754 --> 01:49:07,982
- Water.
- Shut up.

944
01:49:09,514 --> 01:49:12,503
- Water.
- Give him some water, for Heaven's sake.

945
01:49:14,553 --> 01:49:17,826
It's in the back.

946
01:49:52,754 --> 01:49:55,266
How are you?

947
01:49:57,234 --> 01:49:58,824
Fine.

948
01:49:58,993 --> 01:50:03,540
Damn, I have to be shot in the lung
to be cared for by you.

949
01:50:14,113 --> 01:50:16,067
So ...

950
01:50:23,073 --> 01:50:27,062
- I'm going to prison, Marie.
- In prison?

951
01:50:27,233 --> 01:50:30,347
- I don't think so.
- Yes.

952
01:50:30,513 --> 01:50:34,060
I must go to prison for the things
I have done.

953
01:50:36,874 --> 01:50:39,749
When this is over ...

954
01:50:47,673 --> 01:50:50,628
Do you know what I have done?

955
01:50:59,393 --> 01:51:01,347
No.

956
01:51:12,913 --> 01:51:15,379
You'll be fine.

957
01:51:27,394 --> 01:51:30,428
I'll be back tomorrow.

958
01:51:52,674 --> 01:51:55,664
Take care of yourself, J¯rgen.

959
01:56:40,953 --> 01:56:42,510
No, no, no.

960
01:56:43,993 --> 01:56:47,108
Down in the basement. Hurry up!

961
01:56:47,273 --> 01:56:49,739
Hurry up.

962
01:57:12,592 --> 01:57:16,185
Open up now.
Get out!

963
01:57:16,833 --> 01:57:19,584
Open up!
Can't you hear?

964
01:57:22,593 --> 01:57:24,309
Open up!

965
01:57:28,593 --> 01:57:31,424
You must open the door!

966
01:59:28,873 --> 01:59:31,146
Flammen?

967
01:59:31,313 --> 01:59:35,222
Is it Flammen? Speak!

968
01:59:35,392 --> 01:59:37,460
Get some milk.

969
02:00:30,273 --> 02:00:32,421
Stop!

970
02:00:34,312 --> 02:00:37,346
What are you doing?

971
02:00:37,512 --> 02:00:40,308
Have you no shame in life?

972
02:00:42,272 --> 02:00:45,579
Cover them.
- Yes!

973
02:01:14,833 --> 02:01:17,981
Here's the money order
for the 20,000 kroner.

974
02:01:18,151 --> 02:01:21,379
You can cash it tomorrow.

975
02:01:41,073 --> 02:01:44,539
We also found a letter on him.

976
02:01:46,472 --> 02:01:49,347
It's for you.

977
02:02:06,791 --> 02:02:09,986
Do you remember when they came?

978
02:02:11,352 --> 02:02:14,500
Do you remember April 9?

979
02:02:15,873 --> 02:02:17,827
I think you can.

980
02:02:17,993 --> 02:02:20,186
We all can.

981
02:02:21,352 --> 02:02:24,467
I've thought and thought ...

982
02:02:24,632 --> 02:02:29,906
Whatever they say,
I don't believe it was you.

983
02:02:30,071 --> 02:02:33,538
That's not how you are.

984
02:02:38,472 --> 02:02:43,099
Where will we be afterwards?
When this is over.

985
02:02:44,473 --> 02:02:47,621
I don't know.

986
02:02:47,791 --> 02:02:50,508
Is there a way back?

987
02:02:50,672 --> 02:02:52,866
Is there a way forward?

988
02:02:53,033 --> 02:02:55,306
Maybe.

989
02:02:56,472 --> 02:02:58,268
Maybe not.

990
02:02:59,832 --> 02:03:03,344
Right now there is only Flammen.

991
02:03:46,522 --> 02:03:50,522
After the liberation Flammen
and Citronen were buried in Copenhagen.

992
02:03:51,523 --> 02:03:55,523
After the funeral their coffins stood
side by side in Holmen's Church.

993
02:03:56,023 --> 02:04:01,023
A few months later Flammen's father passed away.

994
02:04:03,523 --> 02:04:07,524
Citronen was in 1951 awarded the U.S. president's
distinction for heroism in war: The Medal of Freedom.

995
02:04:08,524 --> 02:04:12,524
Citronen's mother received the Medal
on behalf of her son.

996
02:04:13,524 --> 02:04:17,524
Flammen later received the same honor.

997
02:04:20,024 --> 02:04:24,025
Bodil fled to Sweden,
where she gave birth to her daughter Lene.

998
02:04:25,025 --> 02:04:29,026
After the liberation she lived in a house outside
Copenhagen, where she for many years lived alone
with her daughters.

999
02:04:30,026 --> 02:04:34,026
Citronen's fate marked the family forever.

1000
02:04:36,527 --> 02:04:41,527
After Flammen's death
Ketty Selmer moved to Stockholm.

1001
02:04:42,527 --> 02:04:46,527
She later settled on Mallorca,
where she lived until her death in the mid-1990s.

1002
02:04:47,527 --> 02:04:51,528
She never talked about Flammen.
